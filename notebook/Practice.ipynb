    "During this workshop you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn the basics of neural model analysis and optimization:\n",
    "    - what a model is and how it works\n",
    "    - how to measure its performance and analyze the quality\n",
    "    - how to tune the model for enhanced performance\n",
    "2. Write your own AI application that detects faces and recognizes emotions on video\n",

    "### The Deep Learning Era\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning recently has gained wide popularity due to significant breakthroughs in the artificial neural networks area. Deep Learning has enabled the development of various revolutionary AI applications. With Deep Learning, the algorithm does not need to be taught about the essential features. It can discover features from data on its own using a neural network. Generally, Deep Learning algorithms use a massive amounts of data and aim to simulate the human brain capacity to observe, learn, and make decisions, particularly for highly complex tasks. \n",

    "To perform a specific AI task, the model is firstly trained on the known data. During training, the model makes predictions about what the data represents. Any error in the prediction is used to strengthen the artificial neuron connections until the acceptable accuracy level is achieved. The process of training usually happens only once, requires massive amount of data and powerful computing systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of using a pre-trained model to make predictions against previously unseen data is called inference. Inference is performed on different devices, happens several times, and consists in feeding the images to the model. In this workshop we will work with model inference, in other words, we will execute the model already pre-trained to perform useful work.\n",

    "2. At the server, a first inference is run to localize the license plate in the image, and a second inference is run to read the characters on the license plate. \n",
