    "1. Learn the basics of neural model analysis and optimization:\r\n",

    "Deep Learning recently has gained wide popularity due to significant breakthroughs in the artificial neural networks area. It has enabled the development of various revolutionary AI applications. With Deep Learning, the algorithm does not need to be taught about the essential features. It can discover features from data on its own using a neural network. Generally, Deep Learning algorithms use massive amounts of data and aim to emulate the human brain capacity to observe, learn, and make decisions, particularly for highly complex tasks. \r\n",

The process of training usually done just once and requires massive amount of data and powerful computing systems. \r\n",

    "The process of using a pre-trained model to make predictions against previously unseen data is called inference. Inference is performed on different devices, happens several times, and consists in feeding the images to the model.
