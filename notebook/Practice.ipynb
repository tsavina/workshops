    "### Why Deep Learning\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Deep Learning is highly popular right now due to significant breakthroughs in the artificial neural networks area, which have encouraged businesses to use deep learning solutions as part of their strategy. From digital assistants and chatbots in customer service to object recognition in retail, and much more, Deep learning has enabled the development of various revolutionary AI applications. With Deep Learning, the algorithm does not need to be taught about the essential features. It can discover features from data on its own using a neural network. The exceptional performance of Deep Learning algorithms with difficult tasks involving massive quantities of data, coupled with the growing availability of pre-trained models, has made Deep Learning very appealing to many companies.\r\n",
    "Example\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### What Is Inference \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "While training is the process of teaching a model to perform a particular AI task, Deep learning inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions against previously unseen data. A trained model is often modified and simplified before being deployed. Some neural models can be large and complex, with hundreds of layers of artificial neurons and weights connecting them. The larger the model, the more memory and energy is consumed to run it, and the longer will be the response time (or latency) from when you input data to the model until you receive a result.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "![](pictures/deep-learning.png)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Author: Mark Robins, Intel, [Link](https://www.intel.ru/content/www/ru/ru/artificial-intelligence/posts/deep-learning-training-and-inference.html)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "But sometimes the use case requires that inference run very fast or at very low power. For example, a self-driving car must be able to detect and respond within milliseconds in order to avoid an accident.In such cases, there is a desire to simplify the model after training to reduce power and latency, even if this simplification results in a slight reduction in accuracy. There are several ways to optimize a model. Further, we will use optimization method called INT8 calibration, which involves reducing the numerical precision of the weights from, for example, 32-bit floating point numbers down to 8-bit, resulting in a reduced model size and faster computation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's take a look at the inference on the real-life example of vehical detection model. The model running alongside the traffic camera constantly processes a video to detect vehicles entering the intersection. If a vehicle enters when the light is red, multiple images of the vehicle are captured and fed into the model, which finds an image that includes a license plate and transmits it for further processing. At the server, a first inference is run to localize the license plate in the image, and a second inference is run to read the characters on the license plate. Finally, the license plate information is sent to the data center where an application looks up the car’s owner based on the license plate and detects up potential traffic violations to be reviewed.\r\n",
